    "\n",
    "* problems requiring lots of fine-tuning outputs / long list of rules\n",
    "\n",
    "* complex problems with poor traditional solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "* fluctuation in data\n",
    "\n",
    "* gaining non-obvious insights about complex problems/big data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type of ML\n",
    "\n",
    "* existence of human supervision (supervised, unsupervised, semisurpervised, reinforcement)\n",
    "\n",
    "* capacity of learning incrementally on the fly (online vs batch)\n",
    "\n",
    "* algorithm compares new data to known data points OR detect patterns in training data to build predictive model (instance-based vs model-based)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn from the past or learn from someone else\n",
    "\n",
    "* classification - provide label at end of training\n",

    "\n",
    "Extract information from unlabeled data via clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "IN THIS CLASS...\n",
    "* k-means\n",
    "* DBSCAN\n",
    "* hierarchical cluster analysis\n",

    "Dimensionality reduction simplifies data without losing too much information. It could be done, for example, by merging several correlated features into a single dimension.\n",
    "(e.g. car's mileage may be correlated with age, so the dimensionality reduction algorithm will merge them into one feature to represent the car's wear and tear)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **feature extraction**, and it's a very important step in ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semisupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Labeling data is usually time-consuming and costly, and data is often unlabeled. ...but some algorithms can deal with data that's partially labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e.g. Google Photo notices the same person in multiple uploaded images; user identifies people; algorithm extends identification to others)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent observes the environment, selects/oerforms action, and gets a reward in return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm must, then, learn by itself what the best strategy (policy) is that gets the most reward over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A policy defines what action the agent should choose in a given situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset organization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Batch learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* system is incapable of learning incrementally; must be trained using all available data (lots of time, resources)\n",
    "* incorporating new data requires new system version\n",
    "* training using full dataset can take many hours\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Online learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* feed data into system incrementally/sequentially, individually or by small groups (mini-batches)\n",
    "* fast, cheap, can learn about new data on the fly\n",
    "* important parameter: speed of adapting to changing data: **learning rate**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalization\n",
    "AKA: how do you deal with generalizing new information?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instance-based learning\n",
    "Take identical or \"similar\" (need to define a similarity metric!) inputs and judge identically\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model-based learning\n",
    "Build model of examples, then use model to make predictions"
